Flashcard learning application with a flexible templating engine.

# Idea

Several years ago, I used a Spaced Repetition System to learn Japanese.
It helped me memorize thousands of characters in only a few weeks! And believe me, I don't have a good memory.

And although spaced repetition is a very powerful tool, none of the people I suggested it to would end up using it regularly.

Part of the reason is the complex UI of existing software, which creates a high entry barrier for first-time users.
_Hootini_ is my attempt to create an application that is easy to understand, without being restrictive.

This is what sets _Hootini_ apart:

- ‚ú® Clean and functional interface
- ü§∏‚Äç Flexible templating engine
- üìñ Markdown support
- üë©‚Äçüíª Code highlighting
